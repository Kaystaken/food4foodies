##Group Project 1

### Motivation

This is an app for food lovers looking to explore new recipes and meal ideas.

### Why?

We built this project As health-conscious individuals who love to cook and try new recipes.

### Problem Solved

The site is filled with many recipe options for anytime of the day with the ability for users to search for whatever they desire.

### Learnings

We learned so much during this project. Working as a team for the first time using the project dsection in GitHub. Having daily scrums, and communicating ideas using/updating the Kanban board. working with a new styling platform called Tailwind and reading and understanding the documentation. We learned to check APIs and that need to be obtained before starting the project so time isn't wasted and to accept failure but not quit. Doing pull requests and merging protected branches.
